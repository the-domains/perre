# Paris Sky
![Paris in June, 2013. Lying in a park, looking into the sky through trees.](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/c9e48764f0c0441a3bb23482616889c565904f90.png)

On my first day back to Paris in ten years, Frida and I picked out sandwiches and pastries from Gosselin. In the 1st arrondissement was experiencing lots of construction at the time, so walked to a nearby park at the base of Le Marais called Square Henri Galli to enjoy a picnic spread. I began taking photos, then marveled at something. I was including buildings in the photos.  In Los Angeles, I unconsciously excluded buildings. If in a photo, they were incidental to the subject I was taking. But here, in the grass in Paris, the buildings contributed something.

  On my first day back to Paris in ten years, Frida and I picked out sandwiches
  and pastries from Gosselin. The 1st arrondissement was busy with construction
  at the time, so we walked to a nearby park at the base of Le Marais called
  Square Henri Galli to enjoy a picnic. I began taking photos, then marveled at
  something. I was including buildings in the photos. In Los Angeles, I
  unconsciously excluded buildings, so that if architecture appeared in a photo,
  they were for me incidental to the subject I was taking. But here, in the
  grass in Paris, the buildings contributed something.

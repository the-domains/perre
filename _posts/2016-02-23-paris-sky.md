  On my first day back to Paris after ten years, Frida and I picked out
  sandwiches and pastries from Gosselin. The 1st arrondissement was busy with
  construction so we walked to a quiet, nearby park at the base of Le Marais
  called Square Henri Galli. After our a picnic I began taking photos, then
  marveled at something. I was including buildings in the photos. In Los
  Angeles, I unconsciously excluded its architecture, so that if buildings
  appeared in a photo, they were for me incidental to the subject I was taking.
  But here, in the grass in the centre of this metropolis, the buildings
  contributed something.
